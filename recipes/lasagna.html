    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Lasagna is a popular Italian dish that typically consists of layers of flat pasta noodles, meat or vegetable sauce, 
        and cheese. The noodles are usually cooked beforehand and then layered with the sauce and cheese. The sauce can be made 
        with a variety of ingredients such as ground beef, pork, or turkey, as well as vegetables like spinach or eggplant, and 
        often includes tomatoes and herbs like basil and oregano. The cheese used in lasagna is usually a combination of mozzarella, 
        ricotta, and parmesan. The layers of pasta, sauce, and cheese are repeated until the dish is filled and then baked in the oven 
        until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Lasagna is often served as a main course and can be accompanied by garlic bread and a salad.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Olive oil, plus a little for the dish</li>
        <li>750g lean beef mince</li>
        <li>90g pack prosciutto</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>200ml Hot beef stock</li>
        <li>A little grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>300g pack fresh lasagne sheets</li>
        <li>White sauce</li>
        <li>125g Ball mozzarella, torn into thin strips</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan and cook 750g lean beef mince in two batches for about 10 mins until browned all over.</li>
        <li>Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto from a 90g pack, then stir through the meat mixture.</li>
        <li>Pour over 800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce recipe and 200ml hot beef stock. Add a little grated nutmeg, then season.</li>
        <li>Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins until the sauce looks rich.</li>
        <li>Heat oven to 180C/fan/160C/gas 4 and lightly oil an ovenproof dish (about 30 x 20cm).</li>
        <li>Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then cover with some fresh lasagne sheets from a 300g pack. Drizzle over roughly 130g ready-made or homemade white sauce.</li>
        <li>Repeat until you have 3 layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining 390g white sauce, making sure you canâ€™t see any pasta poking through.</li>
        <li>Scatter 125g torn mozzarella over the top.</li>
        <li>Arrange the rest of the prosciutto on top. Bake for 45 mins until the top is bubbling and lightly browned.</li>
