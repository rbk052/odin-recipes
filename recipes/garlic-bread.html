        <p>
            Garlic bread is a popular side dish or appetizer that is made from slices of bread, 
            typically a baguette or Italian bread, that has been infused with garlic and butter or olive oil. 
            The bread is usually sliced lengthwise, and a mixture of softened butter or olive oil and minced garlic 
            is spread generously over each slice. Other herbs and spices like parsley, oregano, and red pepper flakes 
            can also be added to the garlic butter mixture for extra flavor. The bread is then baked in the oven 
            until it is crispy and golden brown. Garlic bread can be served as a side dish to pasta, soups, or 
            salads, or it can be enjoyed as an appetizer on its own. Garlic bread is often served hot, and it is 
            a simple and delicious addition to any meal.
